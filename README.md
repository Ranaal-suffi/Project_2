# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
I want to determine a relationship between the number of available bikes and the rating of a particular location.

## Process
### Collect data:
- Collect data from citybikes
- Collect the data from yelp lat and long from citybikes
- Collect the data from foursquares using the lat and long from citybikes
### Convert data into dataframe
- Convert all data to dataframe
### Study the results
- Isolate the columns that can be used for our statistics modeling, like the rating, the numbers of available bikes, etc.

## Results
- There is not a significant relationship between resturant ratings and available bikes. The higher the number of bikes available the higher the ratings

## Challenges 
- The amount of API calls wasted 24hrs because I ran out of credits
- The relationships in the data was very insignificant or not easy to see

## Future Goals
Try to find relationships between resturant rating and lattitude and longitude or available bikes and lat+long
